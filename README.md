***Calendar

A simple JS/Google calendar interface that highlights dates which contain events (i.e. date is booked).  I used FullCalendar to display a JS calendar(FullCalendar)[http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/].  By specifying a Google API key and Google public calendar ID in the EventsController file, dates with events on the Google calendar will be styled/highlighted on the JS FullCalendar in accordance with the styling specified in the "booked" class within the calendar.css file.
