###JavaScript Calendar Which Shows Dates Booked on Linked Google Calendar

A simple JavaScript/Google Calendar interface that highlights/styles dates on a JavaScript calendar for dates which contain events (i.e. date is booked) on a public Google Calendar.  I used the [FullCalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) jQuery plugin to display a JavaScript calendar.  By specifying a Google API key and Google public calendar ID in the EventsController file, dates with events on the Google calendar will be styled/highlighted on the JavaScript calendar in accordance with the styling specified in the "booked" class within the calendar.css file.
